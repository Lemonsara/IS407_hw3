Hello, here are some data about the shoes and I make some visualization on that. The main focus is on the relationship between prices and some other factors. 

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv("data.csv")

# 1. Distribution of Prices
ggplot(data, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 500, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Original Prices", x = "Price", y = "Count")


# 4. Breakdown of Products by Brand
data %>%
  count(brand) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(brand, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "orange", color = "black") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Number of Products by Brand", x = "Brand", y = "Count")

# 6. Breakdown of Products by Size
data %>%
  count(size) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(as.factor(size), n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "pink", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Number of Products by Size", x = "Size", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# 7. Relationship Between Price and Another Variable (Size)
ggplot(data, aes(x = as.factor(size), y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "cyan", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Prices by Size", x = "Size", y = "Price") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```
